# Audit Reports Collection

## Overview

This directory contains curated smart contract security audit reports from part of leading blockchain security firms. These reports serve as the foundation for the FORGE Curated vulnerability dataset.

## Selected Audit Firms

We have collected reports from the following 11 prominent audit teams:

- [BlockSec](https://github.com/blocksecteam/audit-reports/blob/main/solidity)
- [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio?section=cantina-reviews)
- [ChainSecurity](https://www.chainsecurity.com/smart-contract-audit-reports)
- [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.security/audits/)
- [Immunefi](https://github.com/immunefi-team/Past-Audit-Competitions)
- [MixBytes](https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/research#solidity)
- [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-reports)
- [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/)
- [Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications)
- [Zenith](https://github.com/zenith-security/reports)

## Selection Criteria

The audit firms were selected based on the following criteria:

- **Public Availability**: Reports are publicly accessible and well-documented
- **Report Quality**: Detailed findings with clear vulnerability descriptions, severity classifications, and code locations
- **Source Code Accessibility**: Audited projects have publicly available source code repositories
- **Industry Recognition**: Established reputation within the blockchain security community
- **Coverage**: Reports span a diverse range of audited protocols and vulnerability types, with a minimum of five publicly released audit reports within the collection timeframe

## Important Disclaimer

**This collection represents an initial curation effort and does not:**

- Constitute an official ranking or endorsement of audit quality
- Imply that these firms are superior to others not included
- Guarantee the absence of security vulnerabilities in audited projects
- Suggest that projects audited by these firms are risk-free

Moreover, audit quality can vary across individual reports.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand this collection gradually by incorporating reports from additional prominent audit teams, including [SlowMist](https://slowmist.io/), [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/), [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com/), [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io/), [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), and so on, as well as bug bounty disclosures from [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/). We actively welcome and encourage community-driven contributions through pull requests and issues to help identify and suggest new audit firms or high-quality reports. To maintain the integrity and usability of this dataset, all proposed additions will be carefully evaluated against our established selection criteria, prioritizing quality over quantity to ensure each new entry adds meaningful value to the FORGE Curated dataset.
