/// @notice Combined Safe extensions providing both liveness module and timelock guard
///         functionality.
/// @dev This contract can be enabled simultaneously as both a module and a guard on a Safe:
///      - As a module: provides liveness challenge functionality to prevent multisig deadlock
///      - As a guard: provides timelock functionality for transaction delays and cancellation
///      The two components in this contract are almost entirely independent of each other, and can
///      be treated as separate extensions to the Safe. The only shared logic is the
///      _checkCombinedConfig which runs at the end of the configuration functions for both
///      components and ensures that the resulting configuration is valid. Either component can be
///      enabled or disabled independently of the other. When installing either component, it
///      should first be enabled, and then configured. If a component's functionality is not
///      desired, then there is no need to enable or configure it.
///      This contract is compatible only with the Safe contract version 1.4.1 due to the
///      compatibility restrictions in the LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard contracts.
