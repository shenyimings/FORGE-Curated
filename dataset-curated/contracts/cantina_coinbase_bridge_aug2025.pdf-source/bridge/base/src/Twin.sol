/// @title Twin
///
/// @notice Execution proxy contract that represents Solana users on Base, enabling cross-chain interactions.
///
/// @dev Each Solana user gets their own deterministic Twin contract deployed when they first interact with Base.
///
///      **Key Characteristics:**
///      - Deployed deterministically using the user's Solana pubkey as salt via ERC-1967 beacon proxy pattern
///      - Acts as the user's "representative" or "twin" on Base for receiving tokens and executing transactions
///      - Can execute arbitrary calls on behalf of the Solana user (regular calls, delegate calls, contract creation)
///      - Can receive ETH directly via the receive() function
///      - Secured by authorization - only the Bridge contract or the Twin itself can execute calls
///
///      **Deployment Process:**
///      1. When a Solana user sends a message to Base for the first time, the Bridge contract checks if a Twin exists
///      2. If no Twin exists, it deploys one deterministically using LibClone.deployDeterministicERC1967BeaconProxy
///      3. The salt is derived from the user's Solana pubkey, ensuring the same address every time
///      4. All future interactions for that user will use the same Twin contract
