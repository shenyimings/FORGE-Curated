            "description": "1.  **Description:** The ShortsTracker can become temporarily desynchronized because it is not updated when a user directly calls vault.decreasePosition, bypassing the standard order execution path through PositionRouter.\n2.  **Cause:** The update to global short data is only triggered via PositionRouter during order execution (via updateGlobalShortData), but direct position decreases on the Vault contract do not invoke this logic.\n3.  **Exploitation:** An attacker or user could directly call decreasePosition on the Vault, causing the ShortsTracker to report outdated or incorrect short position data until a subsequent update via PositionRouter or external trigger.\n4.  **Impact:** This could lead to temporary inaccuracies in short position tracking, potentially affecting pricing, liquidation logic, or user incentives until the data is resynchronized. The impact is limited in duration and scope, hence the low severity.\n",
