            "description": "The new MkrSky deployment only supports one-way conversion from MKR to SKY, disabling the previous bidirectional functionality. This change is caused by the design decision to deprecate the SKY \u2192 MKR conversion path upon initialization of the new converter. As a result, external integrator protocols that rely on the SKY \u2192 MKR path will no longer be able to use it. This could lead to operational disruptions for these protocols if they are not prepared for the change. The impact is primarily on integration continuity and user experience rather than direct fund loss or contract compromise.\n",

            "title": "MKR mint authorities can be removed",
            "description": "The MkrSky contract assumes no additional MKR tokens will be minted, as a fixed amount of SKY is pre-minted based on the current MKR total supply. However, the MKR token's minting authority still permits certain contracts, such as DssVestMintable and the MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, to mint new MKR tokens. This situation arises because the minting permissions have not been fully revoked, leaving open the possibility of unexpected MKR supply increases. If new MKR were to be minted, it would break the 1:1 equivalence assumption between MKR and SKY, potentially undermining the economic model of the Sky system. While no active exploit is known, this represents a risk to the system's long-term integrity.\n",
