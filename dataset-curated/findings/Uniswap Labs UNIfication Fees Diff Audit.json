            "description": "1. **Description:** The `OptimismBridgedResourceFirepit.sol` contract contains two unused imports: `ERC20` from `solmate/src/tokens/ERC20.sol` and `SafeTransferLib` from `solmate/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol`. These imports are not referenced anywhere in the contract.\n2. **Cause:** The imports were included in the source file but are not utilized in the implementation, likely due to refactoring or oversight during development.\n3. **Exploitation:** This issue cannot be exploited by an attacker as it does not introduce any functional vulnerabilities or security risks.\n4. **Impact:** The presence of unused imports increases the bytecode size slightly and reduces code clarity and maintainability, making the codebase harder to audit and understand.\n",

Failure to update these values before deployment could result in misdirected assets or broken functionality, but the core logic remains secure.\n",

            "description": "1. **Description:** The `release` function in the `ExchangeReleaser.sol` abstract contract does not emit an event upon successful execution, despite performing a critical operation: releasing assets from the `TokenJar`.\n2. **Cause:** The function was implemented without including an event to log the release action, likely an oversight in design for off-chain observability.\n3. **Exploitation:** This cannot be exploited maliciously, but it hinders external systems from tracking or reacting to asset releases in real time.\n4. **Impact:** The absence of an event reduces the transparency and auditability of the system, making it difficult for indexers, monitoring tools, and users to observe when and how assets are released, potentially affecting trust and integration capabilities.\n",
