            "description": "The ZeroBase.s.sol deployment script contains commented-out Forge CLI commands that include hardcoded Etherscan API keys. The root cause is the inclusion of sensitive credentials directly in source code, even when inactive. Although these commands are not executed, the presence of API keys in public repositories poses a security risk, as they can be scraped and abused, leading to quota exhaustion or unauthorized access to Etherscan's API services. This also reflects poor maintainability and operational security practices. The impact includes potential disruption of development workflows due to revoked or rate-limited API access if keys are compromised.\n",

This absence increases the risk of undetected bugs, regressions, or incorrect behavior in core functionalities such as deployment, ownership assignment, and token operations. The root cause is the omission of Foundry-style test files in the `test/` directory. Without automated tests, manual verification becomes error-prone and insufficient for ensuring reliability, especially in a cross-chain context. The impact is reduced confidence in contract correctness and increased risk during future development or upgrades.\n",

This creates an incomplete validation of bidirectional cross-chain functionality, which is essential for a fully operational omnichain token. Additionally, the script uses a hardcoded recipient address that corresponds to the contract owner, which may bypass certain checks and fail to represent real-world usage. The root cause is incomplete test coverage and reliance on privileged addresses. The impact is potential undetected failures in reverse transfers and inaccurate simulation of user interactions.\n",
