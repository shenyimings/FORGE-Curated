            "title": "Missing checks in the DssExecLib.sol",
            "description": "1. **Description:** Two distinct issues were identified in DssExecLib.sol. First, there is an asymmetry between the functions setIlkMaxLiquidationAmount and setIlkMinVaultAmount, where the former lacks a check against the dust parameter, potentially leading to incorrect state initialization. Second, the tip parameter is cast to uint192 when being set, but the operation _amount * RAD could exceed the maximum value representable by uint192, risking overflow.\n\n2. **Cause:** The first issue arises from inconsistent validation logic between two related functions, creating a dependency on the order of execution. The second issue stems from insufficient range checking when assigning a potentially large value to a smaller integer type.\n\n3. **Exploitation:** An attacker or misconfigured operation could exploit the first issue by setting parameters in the wrong order, leading to inconsistent collateral configuration. For the second, if a large value is assigned to tip, it could overflow, resulting in a truncated or incorrect fee being set.\n\n4. **Impact:** The impact includes potential misconfiguration of collateral parameters and incorrect fee settings, which could disrupt protocol operations or lead to economic imbalances. However, the issues were classified as informational due to mitigating factors such as correct usage in existing spells.\n",

            "title": "Minor issues, Typos & Documentation",
            "description": "1. **Description:** This finding encompasses five minor issues: (1) use of a legacy flip function instead of clip; (2) inaccurate comment describing tip as a \"max amount\" when it is a flat fee; (3) lack of calc parameter setting (tau/cut/step) in addCollateralBase; (4) reference to a missing GOV_GUARD key in the chainlog; and (5) failure to add the ilk to LINE_MOM in addNewCollateral.\n\n2. **Cause:** These issues stem from outdated code patterns, inaccurate documentation, and incomplete function encapsulation due to Solidity's limitations in polymorphism.\n\n3. **Exploitation:** These are not directly exploitable security vulnerabilities but could lead to confusion, incorrect assumptions, or require additional manual steps during deployment.\n\n4. **Impact:** The impact is minimal, primarily affecting code maintainability, clarity, and operational safety. Some fixes were implemented, while others were acknowledged for future updates.\n",
