            "description": "This finding encompasses several minor issues in the codebase, including outdated Solidity pragma version, inaccurate comments, incorrect inheritance descriptions, formatting issues in conditional statements, and lack of clarity in documentation regarding unsupported token behaviors. The root cause is insufficient code review and documentation maintenance. These issues do not directly lead to security exploits but reduce code clarity and maintainability. An attacker cannot directly exploit these issues, but they may lead to misunderstandings during future development or audits. The impact is limited to code quality and developer experience, with no direct financial or operational risk.\n",
