            "description": "The external functions executeOffsetPhase, executeRestorePhase, and renounceRoleWhenExpired lack access control modifiers and can be called by any address. \nThe root cause is the absence of role-based access restrictions on functions that perform critical system operations, which deviates from the principle of least privilege. \nAlthough internal validation logic (_validate) ensures these functions can only succeed under specific conditions, any external actor can still attempt to call them, potentially leading to unnecessary gas costs or confusion in system state transitions. \nThe impact of this issue is limited due to the existing validation checks, meaning there is no direct exploit path for fund theft or full system compromise; however, it increases the attack surface and weakens the overall security posture by allowing unrestricted access to sensitive configuration functions.\n",
