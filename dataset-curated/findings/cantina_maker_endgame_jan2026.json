            "title": "Incorrect Constant Naming and Missing Test Validation",
            "description": "The vulnerability involves two minor issues in the test and integration code: (1) incorrect naming of constants REWARDS_LSSKY_SKY and REWARDS_DIST_LSSKY_SKY, which should be REWARDS_USDS_SKY and REWARDS_DIST_USDS_SKY respectively, leading to potential confusion in code maintenance and readability; and (2) the test at line 358\u2013364 does not verify that VestedRewardsDistributionJobLike and chainlog were set correctly, which could result in undetected misconfigurations during deployment. The root cause is insufficient attention to detail in naming conventions and incomplete test coverage. While this does not pose a direct security risk, it could lead to operational errors or misinterpretations during audits or upgrades. An attacker could potentially exploit the ambiguity in configurations if not corrected, though the impact is minimal. The impact is limited to code clarity and reliability of test assertions, with no direct financial or functional consequences.\n",
