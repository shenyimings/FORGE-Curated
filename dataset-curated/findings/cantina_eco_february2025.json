            "description": "The IntentVault contract uses an incorrect predicate `amount < balance` in a conditional check that reverts if the balance is insufficient. This logic is flawed because it allows an attacker to deposit excess tokens into the vault, making the balance greater than the intended reward amount. As a result, when a filler attempts to withdraw rewards, the condition `amount < balance` becomes true, causing the transaction to revert due to an assumed insufficient balance, even though sufficient funds are present.\n\nThe root cause is the misuse of the comparison operator in the balance validation logic. Instead of checking if the available balance is sufficient (i.e., `balance >= amount`), the code checks the inverse, leading to incorrect reverts.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this by funding an intent vault with more tokens than specified in the reward structure. This can be done by anyone, including a malicious intent creator, who can then block legitimate fillers from claiming their rewards.\n\nThe impact is critical as it disrupts the core functionality of reward distribution, potentially leading to denial of service for fillers and undermining trust in the protocol.\n",

Since this address does not implement the required function, the call reverts, making it impossible to fulfill any ERC-7683-compliant intent.\n\nThe impact is high because it renders the entire ERC-7683 integration non-functional, preventing interoperability with external fillers and limiting the protocol's utility.\n",
