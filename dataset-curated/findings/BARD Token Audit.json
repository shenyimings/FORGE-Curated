            "title": "Duplicate Event Emission in mint",
            "description": "The `mint` function emits a custom `Mint(to, amount)` event, while the underlying `ERC20._mint` function also emits a `Transfer(address(0), to, amount)` event. These two events convey identical information regarding the creation and allocation of new tokens.\nThe root cause is the redundant emission of a custom event when the standard ERC-20 `Transfer` event from `_mint` already provides the same data, leading to duplication.\nAlthough this does not enable direct exploitation, it can mislead off-chain indexers and user interfaces that rely on event parsing, potentially causing confusion or incorrect state interpretation.\nThe impact is limited to user experience and system clarity, with no direct financial or security risk, but it increases the complexity of event handling and may lead to incorrect assumptions in dependent systems.\n",

            "description": "The contract uses smaller integer types (`uint8`, `uint32`, `uint40`) for constants and state variables where `uint256` would be more appropriate. While functionally correct, this choice provides no storage benefit for constants and incurs a slight gas cost for `lastMintTimestamp` due to type masking.\nThe root cause is suboptimal type selection that does not align with Solidity's EVM optimization patterns, where `uint256` is the native word size and operations on smaller types can be more expensive.\nThis could lead to marginally higher gas consumption during `mint` calls and reduced code clarity for developers expecting consistent type usage.\nThe impact is minor inefficiency and reduced code readability, with no direct security vulnerability but a missed opportunity for optimization.\n",

            "description": "The constructor includes a manual check to ensure `_treasury` is not the zero address before minting, but this is redundant because the `ERC20._mint` function already performs this validation and reverts appropriately.\nThe cause is an unnecessary duplication of a safety check that is already enforced by the inherited OpenZeppelin contract.\nThis increases code complexity without adding security, and creates inconsistency with the `mint` function, which relies solely on `_mint` for this validation.\nThe impact is minimal, limited to increased bytecode size and reduced code clarity, but it violates the principle of least surprise and consistency in error handling.\n",
