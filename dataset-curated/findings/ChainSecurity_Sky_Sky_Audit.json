            "description": "1. **Description:** The initialization function NgtInit.init() did not validate the rate parameter used in the MkrNgt converter, allowing it to be set to an arbitrary value during deployment.\n2. **Cause:** The lack of input validation in the deployment script for the rate parameter, which is critical for maintaining the correct conversion ratio between MKR and SKY tokens.\n3. **Exploitation:** A malicious or erroneous deployer could set an incorrect rate, distorting the token conversion mechanism and potentially causing economic imbalance or loss of trust in the system.\n4. **Impact:** Users could be misled or suffer financial loss due to incorrect conversion rates, undermining the integrity of the token system. However, since the issue was corrected in Version 3, the impact was mitigated before deployment in later versions.\n",
