            "title": "Inefficient Memory Usage in vote Function",
            "description": "1. **Description:** The `vote` function in the `VoteDelegate` contract declares the `yays` parameter as `memory` instead of `calldata`, which results in unnecessary gas costs during execution.\n2. **Cause:** Using `memory` for array parameters forces the EVM to copy data from calldata to memory, increasing gas consumption. Since the data is only read and not modified, `calldata` is sufficient and more efficient.\n3. **Exploitation:** This is not directly exploitable by an attacker, but repeated calls to the function will incur higher gas fees than necessary, affecting user experience and transaction cost.\n4. **Impact:** Increased gas consumption for all users calling the `vote` function, leading to higher transaction costs and reduced efficiency of the contract.\n",
