            "description": "1. **Description:** The `BURNER_ROLE` role identifier is assigned using a raw string literal instead of its `keccak256` hash, deviating from standard practice in OpenZeppelin-based access control systems.\n2. **Cause:** Direct use of a string literal (`bytes32(\"BURNER_ROLE\")`) instead of hashing it with `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\"BURNER_ROLE\"))`.\n3. **Exploitation:** While not directly exploitable, using unhashed role identifiers increases the risk of collisions or confusion if other systems expect hashed roles, potentially leading to misconfiguration.\n4. **Impact:** Reduced interoperability and adherence to security best practices, which could result in integration errors or incorrect assumptions by developers or tooling.\n",
