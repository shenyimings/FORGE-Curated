            "description": "1. **Description:** The LAToken contract lacks tests to validate cross-chain transfers using the LayerZero OFT integration. Although the code was manually reviewed and no immediate issues were found, the absence of dynamic testing poses a maintenance risk.\n2. **Cause:** The LayerZero OFT library was forked and vendored to support ERC-20 permit and OpenZeppelin access control, introducing custom changes whose impact on cross-chain functionality has not been dynamically verified.\n3. **Exploitation:** If LayerZero updates its OFT library and Lagrange upgrades its contracts without proper testing, the custom code could break cross-chain transfers. This could go undetected until after deployment.\n4. **Impact:** A failure in cross-chain transfers would result in token liquidity being segmented across chains, potentially triggering a loss of user confidence and a large-scale sell-off.\n",
