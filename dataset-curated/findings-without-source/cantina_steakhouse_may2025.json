            "title": "Deviation may go undetected due to biased division base currentBackupPrice",
            "description": "1. **Description:** The vulnerability arises because both initialize() and getDeviation() functions use currentBackupPrice (or initialBackupPrice) as the denominator when calculating price deviation. This asymmetric use of the backup price as the base for division introduces a bias in the deviation computation.\n\n2. **Cause:** The root cause is the inconsistent reference point in the deviation formula. When the backup price is higher than the primary price, the calculated deviation becomes smaller than it should be relative to the expected threshold (e.g., 5%), because the higher backup price is used as the denominator. This skews the percentage downward.\n\n3. **Exploitation:** An attacker or malfunctioning oracle could manipulate or allow the backup price to drift significantly higher than the true market price. When this inflated price is used as the denominator in getDeviation(), the resulting deviation percentage will appear smaller than the actual deviation from the primary price, potentially evading detection thresholds.\n\n4. **Impact:** The impact is that significant price deviations may go undetected, undermining the oracle's reliability and potentially leading to incorrect on-chain decisions based on stale or manipulated price data, which could result in financial losses for dependent protocols.\n",
