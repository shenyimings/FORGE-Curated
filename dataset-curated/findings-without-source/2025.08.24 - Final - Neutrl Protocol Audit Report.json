            "description": "The _deposit() function in sNUSD.sol only checks for the SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE but fails to check for FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE, allowing users who are fully blacklisted to bypass restrictions by depositing or minting through another address. \nThe root cause is the incomplete access control logic in the _deposit function, which neglects to validate against the FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE role when performing deposit or mint operations. \nAn attacker who has been fully blacklisted (assigned FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE) can call deposit() or mint() with a different address as the receiver, thereby bypassing the blacklist since the function only reverts for SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE. \nThis leads to a critical impact on regulatory compliance, as blacklisted users can continue to access yield-generating strategies, potentially violating KYC/AML requirements, enabling sanctioned entities to participate, and exposing the protocol to legal and financial risks.\n",
