            "description": "The repository uses multiple versions of OpenZeppelin (OZ) contracts, specifically noting that StakedlvlUSD still uses OZ 4.9 while other parts may use newer versions. This inconsistency stems from incremental upgrades and coexistence of different 4626 implementations. The root cause is lack of uniform dependency management across the codebase. While no immediate vulnerability exists, this increases maintenance complexity and risk of logic errors due to differing contract behaviors. The impact is informational, as it does not present a direct security flaw but could lead to confusion or integration bugs in the future.\n",
