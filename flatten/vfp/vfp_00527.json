            "description": "The second parameter of the `NonceCanceled` event in `ISignatureBasedPaymaster.sol` is named `newNonce`, which is misleading because it actually refers to the nonce that is being canceled, not a new one. This incorrect naming can lead to confusion for developers and external tools interpreting event logs, increasing the risk of misinterpretation during debugging or monitoring. The root cause is poor naming convention, which fails to accurately reflect the parameter's purpose. While this does not lead to direct exploitation or functional bugs, it reduces code clarity and maintainability. The impact is limited to developer experience and potential errors in off-chain systems that consume this event.\n",
