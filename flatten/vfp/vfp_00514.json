            "description": "The implementation only supports Mode 1 of ERC-7821 and omits the mandatory Mode 2 (enhanced single batch with optional data), while also introducing a non-standard mode. This reduces interoperability with other systems expecting full ERC-7821 compliance. The cause is incomplete standard implementation. An attacker could exploit this by crafting transactions that fail unexpectedly due to unsupported modes, leading to denial of service. The impact is reduced compatibility and potential integration issues with third-party tools and wallets.\n",
