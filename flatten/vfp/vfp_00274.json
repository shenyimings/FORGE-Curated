            "description": "The `L2ETHBridge.finalizeDeposit` function forwards `gasleft() / 2` to the recipient during the external call. This arbitrary split may leave insufficient gas for the callee to complete its execution, especially if it performs complex operations or calls other contracts.\n\nThe root cause is the use of a heuristic-based gas forwarding pattern instead of a fixed reserve. This approach is not robust and can lead to unpredictable behavior depending on the initial gas context.\n\nAn attacker could trigger a deposit to a contract that requires more than half of the remaining gas, causing the call to revert. This would prevent the user from receiving their funds, even though the message is valid.\n\nThe impact is potential failure of deposit finalization, leading to user funds being stuck and requiring manual intervention. It reduces the reliability of the bridge and introduces unnecessary risk in message execution.\n",

            "title": "Zero-Amount Withdraw Allows Spam Messaging",
            "description": "The `L2ETHBridge.withdraw` function only checks that `msg.value` is non-zero but does not validate that the `amount_` parameter is greater than zero. This allows users to initiate withdrawals with zero value by paying a minimal ETH amount as `msg.value`, which is later refunded.\n\nThe root cause is missing input validation on the withdrawal amount. The system treats these zero-amount calls as valid messages, which are then included in batches and must be processed by relayers on L1.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this by submitting a large number of zero-amount withdrawals at low cost, forcing relayers to process spam messages. This increases the load on the system and delays legitimate withdrawals, especially under future ZK proof verification which is gas-intensive.\n\nThe impact is a potential denial of service due to resource exhaustion, increased costs for relayers, and degraded user experience as real transactions are delayed in the queue.\n",
