            "description": "The SafeStorage contract is intended to be used as a base contract for storage layout sharing but is not marked as abstract. Marking it as abstract would better reflect its design intent and prevent accidental instantiation. The root cause is a missing language feature usage for design clarity. This has no security impact but affects code semantics and developer understanding. The impact is informational. The issue was fixed post-audit by marking SafeStorage (and SignatureValidatorConstants) as abstract.\n",
