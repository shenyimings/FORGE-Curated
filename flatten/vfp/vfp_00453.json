            "description": "Several comments in the codebase are stale, incorrect, or missing, reducing code readability and maintainability. Examples include outdated @notice tags, misleading @dev comments, and missing @param documentation. The root cause is lack of comment maintenance during development. This can lead to misunderstandings about function behavior or contract logic. The impact is informational, as it does not directly affect security but increases the risk of future bugs or misconfigurations. The issue was fixed by updating the relevant comments.\n",

            "description": "The documentation states that ContentCoin uses creator coins as backing currency, but the contract logic allows any currency (e.g., ETH, other tokens). The root cause is outdated or incorrect documentation. This discrepancy can mislead developers and integrators into making incorrect assumptions about protocol behavior. The impact is informational, as it does not introduce a security flaw but can lead to integration errors or confusion. The issue was fixed by updating the documentation to reflect the actual functionality.\n",
