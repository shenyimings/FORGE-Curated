            "description": "The IWithdrawVault contract defines several events that are never emitted, making them redundant. While this does not pose a direct security risk, it increases contract size and reduces code clarity. The root cause is poor code hygiene and lack of cleanup. This cannot be exploited by an attacker but reflects suboptimal development practices. The impact is increased gas costs and reduced maintainability.\n",
