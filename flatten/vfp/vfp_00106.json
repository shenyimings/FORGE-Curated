            "description": "Several parts of the codebase lack adequate documentation. In FundsLib.depositAssets(), the NatSpec comment inaccurately describes error handling, mentioning only E_ZeroShares when both E_ZeroShares and ZeroShares are handled. Additionally, new contracts like EulerSwapManagement and EulerSwap are missing standard documentation headers and security contact annotations. The flash-swap callback function eulerSwapCall() in IEulerSwapCallee.sol has insufficient parameter documentation, which could mislead integrators.\nThe root cause is incomplete or outdated inline documentation, which fails to reflect the actual implementation or expected usage patterns.\nPoor documentation increases the risk of integration errors, especially for third-party developers using the protocol. Misunderstanding the behavior of functions like eulerSwapCall() could lead to incorrect settlement logic and financial loss for integrators.\nThe impact includes higher risk of integration bugs, reduced developer experience, and potential operational failures due to incorrect assumptions about function behavior.\n",
