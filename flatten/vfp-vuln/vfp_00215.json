            "title": "Front-running attack can bypass callback execution during Safe deployment",
            "description": "The createProxyWithCallback function in SafeProxyFactory.sol is vulnerable to a front-running attack because it uses a predictable salt derivation that can be replicated by the createProxyWithNonce function. The root cause is the shared use of a nonce value derived from user inputs, which allows an attacker to calculate the deployment address in advance. An attacker can observe a victim's transaction in the mempool, compute the same salt nonce, and call createProxyWithNonce before the victim's transaction is confirmed. This results in the attacker deploying the proxy at the intended address, causing the victim's transaction to fail while the critical callback—intended to initialize security parameters or other setup logic—is never executed. The impact is medium, as it can lead to a partially initialized or insecure Safe instance, potentially compromising the intended security model.\n",
