            "description": "The Arbitrum_Adapter and Arbitrum_SpokePool contracts use the `_transferViaOFT` function to bridge tokens via LayerZero's OFT standard. The logic enters this path if the associated messenger address is non-zero, without fallback mechanisms in case the messenger fails. If the messenger reverts during message sending, the entire transaction reverts, preventing both token transfer and the delivery of refund roots to SpokePool. This halts the rebalancing process and blocks relayer reimbursements.\n\nThe root cause is the lack of error isolation—specifically, the absence of a try-catch mechanism or alternative routing when the OFT messenger fails. Because the OFT path is prioritized and canonical bridges (like Arbitrum Gateway) are only checked afterward, a failing OFT messenger blocks all subsequent methods.\n\nAn attacker or malfunctioning messenger could cause a denial-of-service by making the OFT route fail, either through freezing the route or reverting on send. This would prevent the HubPool from executing root bundle settlements involving affected tokens.\n\nThe impact is a complete stall in cross-chain liquidity rebalancing and relayer reimbursements for tokens relying solely on OFT (e.g., USDT), leading to operational disruption and potential financial loss due to delayed or failed settlements.\n",
